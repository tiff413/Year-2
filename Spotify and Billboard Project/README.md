**How have streaming services modified popular musicâ€™s consumption and production?**

In this group project, my role was to:
* [retrieving data](/Data/) using webscraping and Spotify APIs
* [visualising data](/Graphing/) using plotly

**Conclusions**

Despite our initial assumptions, we found that after streaming services were introduced, popular music has been increasingly dominated by a handful of artists. Top songs, especially those that reach number 1, stay at the top of the charts for longer and in a more predictable and consistent manner. Consequently, breakout artist have a lower chance of being introduced in the top charts. 

On the production side, tracks have become increasingly shorter and include more vocals (lower instrumentalness). Although there is a general increase in energy levels over the past 60 years, the average energy has surprisingly decreased since the popularisation of streaming services.
