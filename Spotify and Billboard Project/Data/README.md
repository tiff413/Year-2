<h2>Retrieving Billboard Hot 100 Data (webscrapeBillboard.py)</h2>

This program scrapes the Billboard music chart website and records the Hot 100 songs every week within a certain period.

The program uses Beautiful Soup for webscraping. The datetime module is also used to compare and iterate time, while the time module is used to delay the looping so that the IP address wonâ€™t be blocked.

Inputs | Outputs

1. Spotify audio features of the Year End Hot 100 Billboard songs (per year)
2. Spotify audio features of every Hot 100 Billboard song (per decade)
